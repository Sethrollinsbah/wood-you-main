# Advanced Product Comparison and Wishlist Pro

v1.4.8

Adds ability for customers to compare products and create whishlists.

## Installation

_Advanced Product Comparison and Wishlist Pro_ is installed like any other module. Simply upload your archive to install it.

## Configuration

The module is ready to use after installation. On the module configuration page, you can enable or disable certain functionality or change appearance and behavior of different parts of the module. For example, you can choose where the action buttons will be shown and how the comparison table will look like.

## Usage

After installation, buttons for adding products to comparison and wishlist will appear on catalog and product pages. While wishlist functionality is only available to registered and logged-in users, product comparison can be used by all visitors of your site. Links to comparison table and wishlist (along with the number of products added to them) are shown at the top of every page. These pages can also be accessed from individual user accounts.

This module is compatible with the _Product Feature Tooltips_ module. All feature descriptions you create with the help of _Product Feature Tooltips_ will be available as tooltips in the product comparison table.
