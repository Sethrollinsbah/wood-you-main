## Planification for gift card delivery

This can be modified in the configuration of the module. See section ‘Planification’


> ![alt text](../assets/img/installationguide_userguide_back_planification.png "backoffice cron")

The gift card module must verify daily which gift cards should be sent according to the delivery date selected by the customer during purchase.
A script is executed daily. The module offers two options :

###   First visitor launch

It is the first visitor of the day, or can also be a crawler (Google, Bing,…)
Technically: the module attaches to hookFooter, and when the first visitor goes on your site, the module is notified. The gift card module will verify the gift cards to be sent.
The problem with this method is its dependence on site visits, and the inability to plan an exact date and time of delivery.


###   CRONTAB

This is the recommended method, which allows you to select the exact time of delivery. 
Contact your Webmaster or host so they can put in place the line indicated in bold on the module configuration page.
For example, the line to use in crontab for the site prestashopdemo.timactive.com is:
> ``30 4 * * * curl http://prestashopdemo.timactive.com/modules/giftcard/cron.php&token=PVUNZXE23JRKFS6QI4L8``

## Customize Template with Inkscape

Further information about customization…
This section shows you how to customize a gift card template based on an existing template.

Note: dimensions of a gift card—height: 300 px, width: 191 px. Dimensions of reference used for example for credit cards.

The software used in this tutorial is inkspace, the recommended free software for creating vector images.

### Installing inkscape software

http://www.inkscape.org/fr/telechargement/

Launch inkscape.

### Using an existing template

Find the list of available templates in the gift card module in [your_shop]/modules/giftcard/datadefault/template/ par exemple 1.svg,2.svg...
In inkscape, File->Open and find the svg file you would like to use as your template.
> ![alt text](../assets/img/installationguide_inkscape_template.png "inkscape gift card template")

### Simple modification

#### Importing your logo

The logo you are importing must be high-resolution.
For example, below, the Timactive logo, symbolized by TA, has been integrated into the template. The logo was already in SVG format.
To do this, go to: File → Import →Select your logo
> ![alt text](../assets/img/installationguide_inkscape_template_logoimported.png "inkscape gift card template logo")

#### Selecting your options

If you want to add additional elements, you must ensure that the gift card module will accept them by following the naming rules below :

- *giftcard_price* : price of the gift card
- *giftcard_code* : code of the gift card
- *var_color1*, *var_color2*, *var_color3*,...., *var_color10* : the different types of colors (you can define at most 10 colors)
- *var_text1*, *var_text2*, *var_text3*,...., *var_text10* : the different types of text (you can define at most 10)


#### Additional text

As indicated above, text options must begin with 'var_text' + a number, i.e. : var_textMYNUMBER, and the number must be less than 10
See below the example of additional text 'Mon texte'
