# Simple Tabs

v2.1.0

Adds a tabbed description section to product pages in the front office.

## Installation

_Simple Tabs_ is installed like any other module. Simply upload your archive to install it.

## Usage

### Back office

After installation, a new configuration section will appear in the _Modules_ tab on the product editing page. It provides a list of all tabs created for this product.

To add a new tab, click __New tab__, fill out the form below the tab list and click __Save tab__. To hide a tab and its content from the front office, set the _Enabled_ switch to __No__. Clicking __Cancel editing__ will discard any unsaved changes. To edit or delete an existing tab, use buttons located in the rightmost column of the tab list.

You can assign the same tab to more than one product. Simply check corresponding boxes in the _Additional products_ field when adding or modifying a tab. If you want to assign a tab simultaneously to all products in specific categories, use the _Additional categories_ field.

### Front office

After you assign at least one tab to a product, a new tabbed section will appear in the description area on that productâ€™s page.
